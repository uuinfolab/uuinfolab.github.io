    - title: "Analyzing Intersectional Bias in LLM-based Recommender Systems."
      status: "closed"
      description: "Recently, Recommendation Systems (RSs) have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance personalized recommendations. However, LLMs can perpetuate social biases, raising concerns about their trustworthiness in RSs. RSs are widely used in sectors like job markets, finance, and medicine that critically need fair decision-making. While fairness in traditional RSs has been explored, the trustworthiness of LLM-based RSs remains understudied. Most existing research focuses on bias related to specific group identities such as race or gender. However, recent work emphasizes the need to address “Intersectional Fairness”, where interactions across multiple identity dimensions result in unique discrimination for subgroups. This project aims to comprehensively analyze intersectional biases in both traditional and LLM-based RSs, with a focus on critical applications such as news recommendations."

    - title: "Exploring the Power of LLM-Generated Fake News with the Focus on Scientific Discussions"
      status: "closed"
      description: "Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled malicious actors to generate fake content that mimics the style of trustworthy news sources. Recent studies have revealed that LLM-generated fake news can closely resemble reliable sources of information, reducing the effectiveness of state-of-the-art text-based misinformation detection tools. The rise of misinformation and pseudoscience in scientific discussions on topics such as vaccines, medicine, and climate change is an important societal problem. These beliefs, theories, or practices are disguised as scientific but lack empirical evidence, rigorous methodology, and adherence to the scientific method. They can mislead individuals by presenting unverified or disproven claims as factual, undermining legitimate scientific practices. This project will implement a prompt-based approach to generate realistic fake content related to scientific topics and investigate whether state-of-the-art methods can detect them."

    - title: "Interpretable Anomaly Detection for Tabular Data Using Diffusion Models"
      status: "closed"
      description: "This project aims to develop interpretable anomaly detection techniques for tabular data using diffusion models, leveraging their robust generative capabilities to accurately model complex data distributions. Unlike traditional methods, diffusion models offer a unique approach by gradually transforming noise into structured data, enabling a precise representation of normal behavior. By learning this distribution, we will detect anomalies as significant deviations from the expected patterns. The focus on interpretability ensures that detected anomalies can be understood and contextualized, providing meaningful insights and explanations critical for decision-making in high-stakes domains such as finance, healthcare, and industrial monitoring."

    - title: "Analyzing the Downstream Implications of Pretrained Image Representations in Visual Topic Models"
      status: "closed"
      description: "This project investigates how the choice of pretrained image representation influences the performance and interpretability of visual topic models, focusing on feature extractors trained with different objectives (e.g., language-supervised, self-supervised, or vLLM's). It examines the impact on model fit, topic coherence, and the labels assigned to discovered topics."

    - title: "A comparative study of fairness-aware community detection methods"
      status: "closed"
      description: "With the growing interest in the field of algorithmic fairness, various approaches have been recently introduced to partition graphs into clusters while simultaneously satisfying fairness constraints. This project aims to study and experimentally compare these methods, their scalability, as well as the effect of different demographic fairness functions."

    - title: "Generation of large-scale social networks of formal ties"
      status: "closed"
      description: "In the Data Mining course (prerequisite for this project), you have seen the ER model, which can be used to generate simple graphs. This is a fundamental model to generate random (and thus unrealistic) networks, that can be used to understand whether what we see in real networks is a result of randomness or an actual signal to be analysed. The objective of this project is to define and implement a model that can generate realistic data about formal social ties (that is: family ties, same-workplace, same-school, same-neighborhood, etc.). The work will start with a kind of “multilayered” ER-like model, and define (and implement) a sequence of more and more realistic models by adding non-random assumptions about the distribution of the ties (just as an example, things such as: higher probability of having family ties when people live close by and go to the same school, then longitudinal information about how links evolve in time, etc.). A computational challenge is that this model must be able to generate large data – with 10 to 20 million individuals and billions of ties. This is part of a project where we use registry data to generate population-scale social networks to study segregation and other sociological problems. We need this work both to share data (because we are of course not allowed to share the real data), and to make hypotheses about how such data is generated."
